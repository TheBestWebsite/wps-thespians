We have a great new opportunity this year! Two of our High School students will be directing a 10–15-minute play for a performance in January. This is a great opportunity for students to try an afterschool mainstage show without the huge time commitment of one of our full-length plays!  
Auditions are super easy! Just sign up for the show you would like to audition for using the links below! Nothing to prep! For both shows you will have a 3-minute individual slot then all auditionees will join together for the last 15 minutes. Auditions will be held from 3:15-4:30 on the days listed. 

Unable to make the auditions? Send a video audition to Ms. Becky and she will forward it to the appropriate director!  
   
Performances: January 30th during School, January 31st @ 6pm.  
  
All actors should fill out this [Audition Questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/r/sRNA9UrGbN).

**About the Play**: Young video-gamer Lupe rides the F train by herself every day. She may be a game master, but in real life, she's never done anything extraordinary. That is, until the infamous F Train Monster chooses Lupe as his nemesis in battle -- and she's got to use all her skills to survive. 6-7 actors needed.

**About the Play**: Imagine a society where music has been banned for over 100 years—where a single melody could incur a visit from the Silencers. Despite the risks, a group of teens has been gathering in secret to share ancient stories about music. But when one of them unearths an illegal music device, could this meeting be their last? 5 actors needed – any gender.
