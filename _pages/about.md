WPS Thespians, established in 2021, is a comprehensive theatre program that serves students in grades 5-12, with a distinctive approach where students from all grade levels collaborate equally across every aspect of theatrical production. Rather than dividing responsibilities by age, the program intentionally integrates both middle and high schoolers in all roles—from stage management to set design, lighting, sound, and performance. This cross-grade collaboration creates a unique learning environment where productions are entirely student-designed and student-managed, fostering mentorship, leadership development, and creative problem-solving skills across age groups.

Program Leadership is provided by Ms. Becky Gil, who brings extensive theatrical expertise to the role. As an alumna of both Woodinville High School Thespians and Western Washington University, Ms. Becky has cultivated a rich background in theatre through her involvement in amateur and professional productions throughout the Seattle eastside region. Her years of experience in the local theatre community provide students with authentic industry insights and mentorship.
WPS Thespians philosophy centers on empowering students to take ownership of their artistic journey while developing technical skills, creative problem-solving abilities, and confidence in public performance. This comprehensive approach ensures that participants gain valuable experience in all aspects of theatre production, from conception to final curtain call.
